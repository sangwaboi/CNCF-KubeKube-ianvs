    """Primary metric: Navigation task completion success"""
    return successful_navigations / total_tasks

def path_efficiency(y_true, y_pred, **kwargs):
    """Path efficiency: Optimal vs actual path length ratio"""
    return optimal_length / actual_length

def collision_avoidance(y_true, y_pred, **kwargs):

**5. Complete Setup Guide**
```bash
# Environment setup
conda create -n ianvs-locomotion python=3.11
conda activate ianvs-locomotion
pip install -e /path/to/ianvs

# Run benchmark
cd Industrial_Locomotion_Benchmark
ianvs -f locomotion_benchmarking.yaml

# View results
